1. A two digit number is 18 less than the square of the sum of its digits. How many such numbers
are there?
(1) 1
(2) 2
(3) 3
(4) 4
Ans: Option 2
Take N = 10a+b.
Given that, (10a+b)+18 = K2 = (a+b)2
Given number = K2
- 18 = (10a+b)
That means, when we add 18 to the given number it should be a perfect square. So K2 takes the
following values. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, ....
1 to 16 are ruled out as if we subtract 18 from them, the resulting number is a single digit number.
Now 25 - 18 = 7
36 - 18 = 18
49 - 18 = 31
64 - 18 = 46
81 - 18 = 63
100 - 18 = 82
121 - 18 = 103
Now 63, 82 satisfies.
2. A two digit number is 18 less than the sum of the squares of its digits. How many such
numbers are there?
(1) 1
(2) 2
(3) 3
(4) 4
Ans: Option 2
Only 47 and 67 satisfy the condition
3. For real number x, int(x) denotes integer part of x.int(x) is the largest integer less than or equal to
x.int(1,2)=1,int(-2,4)=-3. Find the value of int(1/2)+int(1/2+ 100)+int(1/2+2/100)+. ..+int(1/2+99/100)
Sol: int (1/2) = 0
int (1/2 + 100 ) = 100
into (1/2 + 2/100) = 0
......
int ( 1/2 + 50/100 ) = 1
int (1/2 + 51 /100) = 1
.......
int (1/2 + 99/100) = 1
So 100 + 1 + 1 + .....50 times = 150
4. Given a square of length 2m. Its corners are cut such that to represent a regular octagon. Find
the length of side of octagon
Sol:
Let x is the side of the octagon and x + 2y is the side of the square.
In the given octagon,
5. Find the number of ways a batsman can score a double century only in terms of 4's & 6's?
Assume the batsman scored x 4's and y 6's.
4x + 6y = 200
⇒

⇒x=100−3y2=50−32y
As x is an integer, y should be a multiple of 2.
If
y = 0, x = 50
y = 2, x = 47
y = 4, x = 44
...
y = 32, x = 2
So total ways are (32-0)/2 + 1 = 17 ( if 0 6's are possible) otherwise 16
6. 5000 voted in an election between two candidates.14% of the votes were invalid.The winner won
by a margin approximately closer to 15%.Find the number of votes secured by the person
Invalid Votes = 14 % (5000) = 700
Valid Votes = 5000 - 700 = 4300 = R (say)
Assume the looser got 'L" votes and winner got "W" votes.
W - L = 15% (R)
W + L = R
Solving we get W = 57.5% and L = 42.5%
So Winner got 57.5%(4300) = 2472
7. There are 100 wine glasses. I offered my servant to 3 paise for every broken glass to be
delivered safely and forfeit 9 paisa for every glass broken at the end of day. He recieved Rs.2.40
.how many glass did he break.
a. 20 b. 73 c. 5 d. 8
If a glass has been broken, he has to loose 3 paisa + 9 paise = 12 paise
Assume K glasses got broken
100 x 3 - 12 x K = 240
⇒
K
=
5
⇒K=5
8. A is 20 percent more efficient than B. If the two person can complete a piece of work in 60
days.in how many days. A working alone can complete the work
a. 80 b. 90 c. 100 d. 110
As A is 20% more efficient than B, If B's per day work is 100 units then A's 120.
Both persons together completes (100 + 120) units = 220 units a day.
They took 60 days to complete the work. So total work = 60 x 220
If A alone set to complete the work, he takes =

9. A property was originally on a 99 years lease and two thirds of the time passed is equal to the four

Solving we get y = 45 years
10. In how many different ways can the letters of the word "LEADING" be arranged in such a way
that the vowels come together
11. a. 360
b. 720
c. 480
d. 5040
Given letters are A, E, I, D, L, N, G
Of which AEI are vowels. Let us combine them into a single letter x. Now total letters are x, D, L, N,
G
These letter are arranged in 5! ways. But 3 vowels can arrange themselves in 3! ways. So total
ways 5! x 3! = 720
12. There is a plane contains 32 points.all the 32 points have equal distance from point x. which of
the following is true .
a. all 32 points lie in circle
b. the distance from x to all 32 points is less than the distance between each other
c. both a and b
d. none of these
Sol: Option 3
X must be the center of the circle and 32 points are on the circumference. So Option A is correct
Number of diagnols of a regular polygon =
n
(
n
−

)

n(n−3)2
So for a polygon of 32 sides, Number of diagnols = 464. Now the minimum distance between any
two points =

Now total lengh of all the distances from 32 points =

π
r
2πr
+ Sum of the lengths of all the 464 diagnols.
Sum of the lengths of x to all the 32 points = 32 radius = 32r
But the 464 diagnols have 16 diameters connecting 2 oposite points connecting via center. So Sum
of the lengths of distances from point to point is clearly greater than sum of the length from x to all 32
ponts. Option B is correct
Correct Option 3

already completed.what is the time.
1. 8 pm
2. 8 am
3. 12 pm
4. 12 am
Sol: A day has 24 hrs. Assume x hours have passed. Remaining time is (24 - x)

13. Perimeter of the backwheel =9 feet,front wheel=7 feet on a certain distance ,the front wheel gets
10 revolution more than the back wheel.what is the distance
Let the backwheel made x revolutions then front wheel makes x + 10
x x 9 = (x + 10) x 7
x = 35
So distance traveled = 35 x 9 = 315
14. There are 2 groups named brown and red. They can n't marry in the same group. If the husband
or wife dies then the person will revert to their own group. If a person is married then the husband

then his mother's brother belong to which group if he is married
a. red
b. brown
c. red and brown

15. A rectangular park 60 m long and 40 m wide has concrete crossroads running in the middle of
the park and rest of the park has been used as a lawn.if the area of the lawn is 2109 sq.m,then what
is the width of the road.
a. 2.91 m
b. 3m
c. 5.82 m
d. none
Option : B
Let us shift the path to the left hand side and top. This does not change the area of the lawn.
Now lawn area = (60 - x) (40 - x)
for x = 3, we get lawn area = 2109.

DIRECTIONS: (Question No. 11 to 15) Read the passage and give your response based on the passage.
PASSAGE
Drug addicts in some countries form small groups, the customs of which may be unknown to outsiders. They often speak a
language that is so full of expressions and words created by themselves that their speech has become unintelligible to those that
are not living, or in some way associated, with them. It is amazing to find that, to understand some of today's so-called pop music,
one requires some acquaintance with the peculiar language of those enslaved to drugs. A great part of the vocabulary is
international with a preponderance of American terms or corruptions of these. This makes it easy for those in search of drug in a
country not their own to communicate with those that have some to dispose of.
11. We learn from the passage that:
(1) All pop singers like drugs
(2) Many pop musicians often use the code language of drug addicts
(3) Pop music is understood by drug users only
(4) All drug users compose music
12. The drug users' speech is unintelligible to other because:
(1) It is incoherent (2) The use of drugs has affected their pronunciation
(3) Their language has peculiar words and expressions (4) They communicate only among themselves
13. Drug addicts:
(1) Get easily assimilated in the society in which they live
(2) Have their own culture
(3) Imitate American culture
(4) Are cultural American culture
14. The international nature of their vocabulary helps drug addicts to:
(1) Buy drugs from one another with ease (2) Get to know one another better
(3) Pass for Americans (4) Conceal their nationalities
15. According to the passage, it is wrong to conclude that:
(1) Drug users have evolved a language
(2) Drug users form small groups
(3) Some drug users travel outside their own countries
(4) All drug addicts are Americans
